Emulator PC-01 Lviv
==
This is PC-01 Lviv emulator written in JavaScript and HTML5.

This project is my first step into the world of Open Source.

This is an emulator of the soviet computer PC-01 "Lvov", which was produced in Ukraine in 1980-s. It was the first Ukrainian computer for home use. To purchase and use it you didn't need the KGB's permission :)

Emulator is made in the form of packaged app for browsers Chromium/Google Chrome and is a cross-platform application. The emulator can be used offline too.

You can download this application at Chrome Web Store [http://goo.gl/iqoj80].

Andrey Chistyakov offered his game "Aerocobra" to include into emulator.
